# Node / Express server

After the benchmark for Go Servers (see [code here](https://github.com/marco-rosner/lightweight-go-server) and the [conclusions here](https://medium.com/p/caadd9a78319), this project is a benchmark comparing pure node server, express server and Fiber (go) server using MongoDB, the winners from Go Servers. We will use some of the rules from [Rinha de beckend](https://github.com/zanfranceschi/rinha-de-backend-2023-q3) to get the results.
